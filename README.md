# Terminal Battleship
Terminal Battleship Game brings the classic board game to your PC terminal.
## Features

This is a single player game in which you the user will be going against the PC.
### Board Visibility
You are able to always see your current board which will show your ships and the PC's guesses

that does not cause collisions/overlap as well as following all Battleship rules.
